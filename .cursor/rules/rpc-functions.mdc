# Available Database RPC Functions and Edge Functions for the Monitoring & Diagnostic Portal

This document merges the previously outlined RPC (Remote Procedure Call) functions with additional functions discovered in your database schema. We also add a new **Edge Function** example based on the style shown before.

## **1. Database RPC Functions**
RPC Calls (from the code references)
get_study_details_with_earliest_latest

Usage: In StudyContext, HolterDetail, etc. to fetch basic study + earliest/latest times.
Input: { p_study_id: string }
Output: Array with a single object containing study_id, pod_id, earliest_time, latest_time, etc.
get_pod_days

Usage: Retrieve an array of distinct days for a given pod.
Input: { p_pod_id: string }
Output: [ { day_value: string }, ... ]
get_clinic_overview

Usage: Summaries for a single clinic (active, total studies, etc.).
Input: { _clinic_id: string }
Output: [{ active_studies, total_studies, average_quality_hours, recent_alerts }]
get_clinic_status_breakdown, get_clinic_quality_breakdown, get_clinic_weekly_quality, get_clinic_monthly_quality, get_clinic_weekly_studies, get_clinic_monthly_studies

Used in ClinicLab, returning different sets of aggregated stats for clinic(s).
Inputs: _clinic_id optional or required
Outputs: Arrays of objects with relevant summary fields.
downsample_ecg

Usage: Returns every nth sample for an ECG for a time range. Called either from an Edge Function or directly.
Inputs: { p_pod_id, p_time_start, p_time_end, p_factor }
Outputs: Array of data points with sample_time, downsampled_channel_1, etc.
aggregate_leads

Usage: Summarizes lead-on and quality across a time bucket.
Inputs: { p_pod_id, p_time_start, p_time_end, p_bucket_seconds }
Output: [ { time_bucket, lead_on_p_1, ..., quality_1_percent, ...} ]
And several other functions, but above are the big ones used in the code.

Edge Functions (in ./supabase/functions)
downsample-ecg/index.ts
Usage: Receives POST requests with JSON: { pod_id, time_start, time_end, factor }.
Internally calls downsample_ecg DB function.
Returns: JSON with the downsampled data and metadata about sampling frequency.
