# SUPABASE, RPC AND EDGE FUNCTION KNOWLEDGE BASE (UPDATED)

This document provides a consolidated reference for all public, user-defined database functions (RPC) and Edge Functions available in your Supabase/Postgres environment. The focus is on functions that support ECG/clinic workflows, including data aggregation, downsampling, study analytics, and temporary data staging. Administrative or TimescaleDB-specific routines are noted separately where applicable.

Description:
Wraps the peak_preserving_downsample_ecg(...) function to ensure critical ECG peaks are retained during downsampling.

Response:
Returns an array of objects with fields corresponding to the database functionâ€™s output.

3. Tables Referenced

The functions above typically reference the following core tables:
	1.	study / study_readings: Contains study information, aggregated stats, and timestamps.
	2.	ecg_sample: Stores raw ECG data including time, channel values, and quality flags.
	3.	clinics, pod: Maintain clinic records and pod (device) statuses.

4. Notable Front-End Usage
	â€¢	ECG Viewer / DataLab Pages:
Utilize functions like get_pod_days(...) and get_pod_earliest_latest(...) to determine query bounds, and aggregate_leads(...) for charting aggregated data.
	â€¢	Study Lists / Overviews:
Functions such as get_study_list_with_earliest_latest(...) and get_studies_with_pod_times(...) support study listing and detail views.
	â€¢	Clinic Dashboards:
Dashboard metrics are provided by various get_clinic_* functions (monthly/weekly stats, quality breakdowns, and overviews).
	â€¢	Administrative / Analytics:
Functions like get_new_studies_and_growth(), get_weekly_active_studies(), get_weekly_avg_quality(), get_per_clinic_breakdown(), and the database monitoring functions support KPI tracking and system analytics.
