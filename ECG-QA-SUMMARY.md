# ECG Visualization QA Enhancements

This document summarizes the quality assurance enhancements made to the ECG visualization system for better diagnostics, error handling, performance optimization, and debugging capabilities.

## Overview of Enhancements

We have significantly improved the ECG visualization system with a focus on robustness, performance, and developer experience. The enhancements span across the following areas:

1. **Diagnostic Infrastructure**
2. **Error Handling and Recovery**
3. **Performance Optimizations**
4. **Developer Tools**
5. **Documentation**

## 1. Diagnostic Infrastructure

### ECG Diagnostics Panel

Created a comprehensive diagnostics panel (`ECGDiagnosticsPanel.tsx`) that provides:

- **Real-time Query Monitoring**: Track ECG data requests with timing and size metrics
- **Performance Analysis**: Memory usage, rendering performance, and optimization recommendations
- **Error Logging**: Centralized error tracking and analysis
- **Common Issues Guide**: Quick reference for troubleshooting typical problems

### Query Tracking System

Implemented a query tracking system (`useECGQueryTracker.ts`) that:

- Records all ECG data queries across the application
- Maintains statistics on query duration, data point counts, and success/error rates
- Persists across component renders using a module-level store
- Provides APIs for both React components and non-React code

## 2. Error Handling and Recovery

### Enhanced Error Classification

Improved error handling in `useECGData` hook with:

- **Error Type Classification**: Network, timeout, authentication, permission, and server errors
- **User-Friendly Messages**: Translated technical errors into actionable user messages
- **Contextual Error Information**: Included time range, pod ID, and query parameters in error details

### Recovery Mechanisms

Added robust recovery features:

- **Retry Functionality**: One-click retry button for failed queries
- **Input Validation**: Pre-request validation of time ranges and parameters
- **Request Abortion**: Automatic cancellation of in-flight requests when parameters change
- **Error Boundaries**: Graceful degradation when errors occur

## 3. Performance Optimizations

### Caching System

Implemented a data caching system in `useECGData` that:

- Stores previously fetched data with TTL (time-to-live)
- Avoids redundant requests for identical queries
- Properly invalidates cache on explicit refetch requests

### Intelligent Downsampling

Added auto-downsampling logic that:

- Automatically adjusts downsampling factor based on time range length
- Prevents excessive data transfer for large time ranges
- Maintains reasonable data density for visualization

### Request Management

Improved request handling with:

- **AbortController Integration**: Cancellation of stale requests
- **Smart Debouncing**: Prevention of rapid successive requests
- **Metrics Collection**: Tracking of query performance for optimization

## 4. Developer Tools

### Debug Mode

Added a comprehensive debug mode to `ECGVisualization` component:

- Toggle-able diagnostics panel via a debug button
- Performance metrics overlay showing data points and query time
- Visual indication of loading, error, and empty states

### Input Validation

Implemented robust input validation that:

- Validates time ranges before making API calls
- Checks for reasonable time spans (max 24 hours)
- Provides specific error messages for invalid inputs

## 5. Documentation

### Enhanced Documentation

Created detailed documentation including:

- **README-ECG-Visualization.md**: Comprehensive guide to the ECG visualization system
- **Troubleshooting Guide**: Common issues and solutions
- **Performance Optimization Tips**: Best practices for optimal performance
- **Component API Documentation**: Detailed prop descriptions and usage examples

## Files Modified/Created

1. **src/components/shared/ecg/ECGDiagnosticsPanel.tsx** (new)
   - Floating diagnostics panel with query, performance, and error monitoring

2. **src/hooks/api/diagnostics/useECGQueryTracker.ts** (enhanced)
   - Query tracking system with metrics collection

3. **src/hooks/api/ecg/useECGData.ts** (enhanced)
   - Improved error handling, caching, and performance optimizations

4. **src/components/shared/ecg/ECGVisualization.tsx** (enhanced)
   - Debug mode, better error handling, and performance monitoring

5. **README-ECG-Visualization.md** (enhanced)
   - Added diagnostics and troubleshooting sections

## Conclusion

These QA enhancements significantly improve the reliability, performance, and developer experience of the ECG visualization system. The addition of comprehensive diagnostics and debugging tools makes it easier to identify and resolve issues, while the performance optimizations ensure a smooth user experience even with large datasets.

The system is now more robust, with proper error handling and recovery mechanisms, and provides detailed feedback to both users and developers when issues occur. The documentation has been enhanced to provide clear guidance on common issues and their solutions.
