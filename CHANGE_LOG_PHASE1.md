# Change Log - Phase 1

## Security Enhancements

- **Replaced insecure expression evaluation:**
  - The `evaluateExpression` function in `HolterLab.tsx`, which previously used a potentially vulnerable `new Function()` approach, has been replaced with a secure expression parser using the `jsep` library. This eliminates the risk of arbitrary code execution from user-provided filter expressions.

## Component Refactoring

- **Created reusable `DataGrid` component:**
  - A new `DataGrid` component (`src/components/table/DataGrid.tsx`) has been developed to centralize table rendering, sorting, and basic display logic. This component promotes code reuse and reduces duplication across the application.
  - The `DataGrid` component supports:
    - Dynamic column definition via a `columns` prop.
    - Sorting by clicking column headers (for sortable columns).
    - Handling of null and undefined values in table data.
    - A clean and consistent visual style using Tailwind CSS.

- **Integrated `DataGrid` into lab components:**
  - The `DataGrid` component has been integrated into the following "lab" components, replacing their previous, individual table implementations:
    - `HolterLab.tsx`
    - `PodLab.tsx`
    - `DataLab.tsx`

## Error Handling

- **Implemented global error boundary:**
  - A `GenericErrorBoundary` component (`src/components/shared/GenericErrorBoundary.tsx`) has been created to provide a consistent error handling mechanism across the application.
  - All application routes defined in `src/routes.ts` are now wrapped with the `GenericErrorBoundary`. This ensures that any uncaught errors within a route's component tree will be caught and displayed gracefully to the user, preventing the entire application from crashing.

## Code Quality

- **Code Review:**
  - A thorough code review was conducted to ensure the quality, maintainability, and security of all changes made in Phase 1.
